## Extensions using internal macros

CPython extensions fall into two categories with respect to our shim:

**Public API only** (`PyList_GetItem`, `PyList_Append`, etc.) — These call functions by name. A pre-compiled `.so`/`.dylib` built against the real `Python.h` will link against our implementations without recompilation.

**Internal macros** (`PyList_GET_ITEM`, `PyList_SET_ITEM`, `_PyList_ITEMS`, etc.) — In the real `Python.h`, these expand to direct memory access into `PyListObject->ob_item[i]`. The compiled extension has that pointer arithmetic baked in. Since our lists are backed by GemStone `OrderedCollection` (not a contiguous C array), these extensions cannot work without recompilation against our `cpython.h`, which routes the macros through function calls.

The same applies to `PyTuple_GET_ITEM`/`PyTuple_SET_ITEM` and any other macro that accesses internal struct fields.

Our adapted `_heapqmodule.c` is an example: the original CPython source uses `_PyList_ITEMS()` for raw array access in the sift operations. We replaced those with `PyList_GET_ITEM`/`PyList_SET_ITEM` calls, which route through GCI to GemStone.
