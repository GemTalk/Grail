# Install Changes and Run Tests
* `./install.sh` # installs all Smalltalk code
* `./scripts/run_tests.sh` # run all Python-related tests (fresh worker sessions; picks up the install automatically)
* `source .setenv` # needed for stand-alone Topaz scripts

## After `install.sh`, refresh a long-lived MCP/topaz session
A session that stays logged in across an `install.sh` will NOT see rebuilt
built-in/canonical Python modules just from an `abort`. `install.sh` bumps
`GrailRuntimeGeneration`, but the per-session generation check is memoized in
`SessionTemps` (`#GrailCanonicalGenChecked`), and already-imported module
instances stay cached in `sys.modules` (also session-local). `abort` refreshes
the DB view (so recompiled *Smalltalk methods* — AST codegen, `Object`, … — ARE
picked up) but touches neither cache, so `import operator` etc. keep serving the
old code. After each `install.sh`, run this in the MCP session:

```smalltalk
importlib resetSessionForReinstall
```

It aborts, un-memoizes + re-runs the generation guard (drops stale canonical
registries), and evicts every non-bootstrap module from `sys.modules` so the
next import rebuilds from disk. (Fresh `run_tests.sh` workers don't need it —
they log in with empty `SessionTemps`.)
